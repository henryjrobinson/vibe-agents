# Story Collection - AI Agents for Capturing Life Stories

A web application that helps elderly users share their life stories through conversational AI, featuring two specialized agents that work together to capture and organize memories.

## Features

### ü§ù Collaborator Agent
- Empathetic conversation facilitator
- Asks thoughtful follow-up questions about family, childhood memories, and life events
- Maintains warm, conversational tone optimized for elderly users

### üß† Memory Keeper Agent
- Real-time extraction of structured data from conversations
- Organizes memories into categories: People, Dates, Places, Relationships, Events
- Provides visual feedback on captured information

### üé® User Interface
- Clean, accessible chat interface adapted from Memorial Mosaic design
- Large text and high contrast for elderly users
- Toggle switches for agent metadata and memory display
- Mobile-responsive design
- Export functionality for stories and extracted memories

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, Custom CSS with CSS Custom Properties
- **AI Backend**: Anthropic Claude 3.5 (Haiku default for speed; Sonnet optional)
- **Deployment**: Render (single Web Service serving both frontend and backend API)
- **Architecture**: Server-backed with SSE streaming (Collaborator) and background tool processing (Memory Keeper)

## Current Architecture (Demo/Prototype)

This repo now targets a demo-friendly, single-origin architecture on Render:

- **Single Render Web Service** serves the static frontend and exposes API endpoints
- **Collaborator** streams responses to the UI via **SSE** (`POST /chat`)
- **Memory Keeper** runs as a **background extraction** publishing updates via SSE (`GET /events`)
- **Backend** runs on **Render** for predictable latency (no cold starts)

See detailed docs in `docs/`:

- `docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/architecture/overview.md`
- `docs/api.md`
- `docs/agents.md`
- `docs/firebase-setup.md`
- `docs/technical-implementation.md`

## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js 18+ (recommended: use nvm with `.nvmrc`)
   - Anthropic API key

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vibe-agents
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your Anthropic API key:
   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use development script (recommended)
   ./scripts/dev.sh
   
   # Option 2: Direct npm command
   npm start
   ```

6. **Access Application**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Environment Management

**Node.js Isolation**: This project uses nvm for Node.js version management to avoid conflicts with other development projects.

**Node.js Version**: 18+ (specified in `.nvmrc`)
```bash
# Recommended: Use nvm for version isolation
nvm use          # Use project-specific version
nvm install      # Install if version not available
```

**Project Setup**: Run the setup script for complete environment isolation
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh   # One-time setup
./scripts/dev.sh     # Daily development
```

**Environment Variables**: All configuration in `.env` file
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Required for AI agents
- `NODE_ENV` - development/production  
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)

**Isolation Benefits**:
- Project-specific Node.js version
- Isolated npm dependencies
- No interference with other projects
- Clean environment setup/teardown

### Render Deployment

1. **Create a Web Service on Render** connected to this repo
2. Render auto-detects `render.yaml` (or set Build: `npm install`, Start: `npm start`)
3. **Environment Variables (Render Dashboard)**
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (required)
   - `SESSION_SECRET` (required)
   - Optional: `PORT=3000` (default) ‚Äî server respects `process.env.PORT`
4. **Health Check**: `/healthz`
5. Open the service URL; the frontend and API are both served from the same origin.


## Usage

1. **Start a Story Session**
   - Click "Start Sharing Your Story" on the welcome screen
   - The Collaborator agent will introduce itself and ask an opening question

2. **Share Your Stories**
   - Type responses in the chat interface
   - The Memory Keeper automatically extracts and organizes key information
   - Toggle agent details and memory display using the header switches

3. **Export Your Session**
   - Click "Export" to download your conversation and extracted memories as JSON
   - Includes timestamp, all messages, and organized memory data

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Optional
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=info
ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
```

### Customization

- **Colors**: Modify CSS custom properties in `css/styles.css`
- **Agent Prompts**: Update system prompts in `js/app.js` (TODO: Move to Claude API integration)
- **Memory Categories**: Adjust categories in the memory extraction logic

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Completed)
- [x] Basic UI with mosaic-inspired design
- [x] Empathetic Collaborator agent (Claude) integrated
- [x] Memory Keeper tool with Anthropic extraction
- [x] SSE streaming for collaborator tokens and memory updates
- [x] Firebase Authentication (client + admin) with user data isolation
- [x] Export functionality

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- [ ] Voice input support
- [ ] Enhanced memory visualization
- [ ] Session persistence and history
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Advanced export formats (PDF, Word)

### Phase 3 (Future)
- [ ] Context Enrichment Agent (photo/ancestry integration)
- [ ] Memory Assessment Agent (healthcare integration)
- [ ] Family sharing and collaboration features
- [ ] Advanced analytics and insights

## API Integration

Agents are accessed via the app server (never call Anthropic directly from the browser):

```bash
# Stream collaborator response (SSE)
curl -N \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <FIREBASE_ID_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST http://localhost:3000/chat \
  -d '{"text":"Hi there","conversationId":"demo","messageId":"1"}'

# Run memory extraction (REST)
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <FIREBASE_ID_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/memory-keeper \
  -d '{"message":"I grew up in Chicago","conversationId":"demo","messageId":"1"}'
```

## Security Considerations

- API keys are handled via environment variables
- Content Security Policy configured via Helmet in `server.js`
- No sensitive data stored client-side
- HTTPS enforced in production

## Accessibility Features

- Large, high-contrast text optimized for elderly users
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Mobile-responsive design
- Simple, intuitive interface
