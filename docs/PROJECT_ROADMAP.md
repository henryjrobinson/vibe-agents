# Story Collection App - Comprehensive Project Roadmap

## üéØ Project Overview

**Mission**: AI-powered story collection system helping elderly users share life stories through conversational AI with automated memory extraction and structured data preservation.

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Firebase authentication integrated, CSP hardened, fully functional prototype on Render

---

# üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Current Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS with modern ES6+ features
- **Backend**: Express.js server with SSE streaming
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (client) + Firebase Admin SDK (server)
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude API with streaming responses
- **Hosting**: Render (single service for frontend + API)
- **Security**: Hardened CSP, token-based auth, user data isolation

### Agent Architecture
- **Collaborator Agent**: Empathetic conversation facilitator
- **Memory Keeper Agent**: Real-time structured data extraction
- **Tool System**: Extensible architecture for future agents

## üìà Development Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
- [x] Express server with SSE streaming
- [x] Firebase authentication integration
- [x] Protected API endpoints with user isolation
- [x] Memory extraction tool architecture
- [x] CSP hardening and security improvements
- [x] Render deployment configuration

### üîÑ Phase 2: Performance & UX (IN PROGRESS)
**Priority: High** | **Timeline: 1-2 weeks**

#### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Switch to Claude 3.5 Haiku for faster responses (50-70% improvement)
- [ ] Implement parallel API calls (Memory Keeper + Collaborator)
- [ ] Add function warming to eliminate cold starts
- [ ] Reduce token limits: Memory Keeper 500‚Üí300, Collaborator 1000‚Üí500
- [ ] Implement streaming responses for better perceived performance
 - [ ] Experiment with model quality vs latency for Collaborator tone
   - [ ] A/B test `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest` vs Haiku for warmth/clarity
   - [ ] Explore Claude 4 variants if significantly better tone (accepting latency)

#### UX Improvements
- [ ] Enhanced error handling with retry logic
- [ ] Better loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Improved mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Voice interface support for accessibility
- [ ] Adjust chat window spacing (padding and subtle borders)
- [ ] Normalize button colors and restyle main chat page
- [ ] Fix header links (Pricing, Support, How it Works)
 - [x] Remove stage directions from Collaborator responses (write empathetically without bracketed actions)

#### Bug Fixes
- [ ] Fix duplicate memory extraction bug
- fix memory extractor login issue after login it says you need to log in but there is no problem it just doesn't refresh


### üöÄ Phase 3: Advanced Features (PLANNED)
**Priority: Medium** | **Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

#### Database & Persistence
- [ ] Migrate from in-memory to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Implement conversation history
- [ ] Add user preferences and settings
- [ ] Session management improvements

#### Advanced Memory Features
- [ ] Memory editing and correction UI
- [ ] Full-text search across memories
- [ ] Memory validation and cross-referencing
- [ ] Enhanced relationship inference and family tree building

#### Tool Ecosystem
- [ ] **Render Scene Tool**: Visual scene generation for memories
- [ ] **Photo Search Tool**: Google Photos integration
- [ ] **Context Enrichment**: Historical context and external data
- [ ] **Memory Assessment**: Cognitive pattern analysis for healthcare

### üîÆ Phase 4: Frontend Modernization (FUTURE)
**Priority: Low** | **Timeline: 3-4 weeks**

#### React Migration (Optional)
- [ ] Vite + React + TypeScript setup
- [ ] Component-based architecture
- [ ] Type-safe API integration
- [ ] Advanced state management
- [ ] Performance optimizations

*Note: Current vanilla JS implementation is working well - React migration is optional*

### üè• Phase 5: Healthcare Integration (FUTURE)
**Priority: TBD** | **Timeline: 4-6 weeks**

- [ ] HIPAA compliance implementation
- [ ] Healthcare provider dashboard
- [ ] Memory quality assessment algorithms
- [ ] Trend analysis and reporting
- [ ] Secure data transmission protocols

## üîß Environment & Deployment

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Core Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

# Firebase Configuration
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key

# AI Configuration

# Optional: CORS for multi-domain setup
CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Deployment

## üìä Success Metrics

- **Memory extraction**: < 5 seconds
- **Uptime**: 99.9%

### User Experience
- **Authentication success rate**: > 95%
- **Session completion rate**: > 80%
- **Error rate**: < 5%
- **User satisfaction**: > 4.5/5

---

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Current Measures
- ‚úÖ Firebase authentication with token validation
- ‚úÖ User data isolation (all data scoped to user ID)
- ‚úÖ Hardened CSP with no unsafe-inline
- ‚úÖ HTTPS-only in production
- ‚úÖ Input validation and sanitization

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Rate limiting per user
- [ ] Data encryption at rest
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] GDPR compliance tools
- [ ] HIPAA compliance (if healthcare features added)

---

## üéØ Key Decisions & Trade-offs

### Architecture Decisions
- **Single Service**: Render hosts both frontend and API (simplicity over microservices)
- **Vanilla JS**: Keep current implementation (works well, elderly-friendly)
- **Firebase Auth**: Chosen for ease of use and security
- **Streaming**: SSE for real-time responses (better than polling)

### Performance Trade-offs
- **In-memory storage**: Fast but not persistent (will migrate to PostgreSQL)
- **Sequential processing**: Simple but slower (will parallelize)
- **Claude 4**: More capable but slower (will test Haiku)
