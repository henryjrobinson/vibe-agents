# Welcome to MemoryKeeper

This short guide appears once after you sign in to help you get started.

## How to use the app

1. **Say hello** and share a short memory or topic you’d like to talk about.
2. The **Collaborator** will respond warmly and ask gentle follow-ups.
3. The **Memory Keeper** quietly extracts _People, Dates, Places, Relationships, Events_ into the panel on the right.
4. You can **reset** the chat anytime or **export** your conversation from the header.

> Tip: short, specific memories work best. For example, “Tell me about your first job” or “What was Grandma like?”
